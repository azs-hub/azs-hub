# Hi there, I'm Anaïs 👋

## About Me
- 🌍 I’m based in France
- 👩‍💻 Senior Frontend Developer specialized in JavaScript
- ✈️ Passionate about travel and learning new languages

I am a front-end developer specializing in JavaScript, with a passion for TypeScript and over six years of experience working across various companies and industries. This journey has provided me with a broad range of skills and insights.

I began my journey as a graphic designer with a year of study, followed by a year at a web design school, where I discovered my passion for web development. This led me to dive deep into a 2-year course at EPITECH, and a 5-year master's degree with ETNA.

During my commitment to web development, it was natural for me to specialize in front-end development. After my studies, I worked for various companies as a front-end developer, gaining an additional 3 years of experience in multicultural environments across Europe and Asia.

I've had the opportunity to work for scale-ups and start-ups, experiencing different management styles along the way.
I am a curious and enthusiastic person, always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set. With a user-centric approach, I excel at bridging the gap between product and tech. I view my challenges as both growing technology and evolving the product.
